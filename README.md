# 🚀 ReactJS: Exercise Delivery - Phase 1

This repository features a curated collection of 9 fundamental ReactJS technical exercises, migrated from vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate mastery over **Hooks**, **State Management**, and **Component Architecture**.

The infrastructure has been architected with a high-performance mindset, utilizing a Multi-Page Application (MPA) structure and automated cloud deployment.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository is built to serve as a centralized hub for 9 fundamental React exercises. I architected this system as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) using Vite and Rollup to ensure each exercise remains an independent entry point. This structure allows for a clean interface where users and recruiters can explore different logic implementations while maintaining a professional, production-ready environment.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building and refactoring this project allowed me to master several advanced front-end development and architectural concepts:

- **Advanced Hook Logic:** I implemented complex state management using useState and handled side effects with useEffect. I focused heavily on manual interval management and cleanup to prevent memory leaks in components like the Pausable Timer.
- **Infrastructure and CI/CD:** I moved beyond local development by configuring automated pipelines with GitHub Actions. This taught me how to manage the lifecycle of a web application from the first commit to the final cloud deployment.
- **Data Persistence Strategy:** Integration of LocalStorage was key to ensuring that user data remains consistent. I learned how to synchronize application state with browser storage to create a seamless user experience.
- **Semantic Structure and SOLID:** I moved away from generic containers to semantic HTML5 tags and followed clean code practices to ensure the repository is maintainable and scalable.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** Functional components and advanced hooks for dynamic interaction.
- **Vite:** High-performance build tool for an optimized development experience.
- **GitHub Actions:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Algorithmic logic, regular expressions, and asynchronous data handling.
